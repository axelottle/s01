Hi, My name is Sean Patrick D. Serrano!

I just finished my internship at Cawil.ai and I'm now in my 4th year. Our learning modality for this week is mostly asynchronous due to Graduation Activities. 

My hobbies include playing video games and reading novels. I enjoy playing RPG, sandbox, and casual games such as Honkai, Terraria, and Cat Snack Bar. Currently, my favorite band is Wave to Earth. I love listening to their songs "Seasons", "Love.", and "Homesick". I also enjoy watching Marvel movies.
